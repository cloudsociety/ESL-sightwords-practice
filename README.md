# Sight Word practice

> A "game" for practicing sight words and vocabulary

Enter a list of words (one per line) into the form and `start`. Clicking the word shows a new random word.

For added fun, hide random letters, the beginning and end letter, or all letters in the middle.

## Build Setup

Should you want to customize it.

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```
